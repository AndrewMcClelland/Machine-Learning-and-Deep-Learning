Q1 - Marginal and Conditional Numeric Distributions
All of question 1 is contained in the file 'Q1_MarginalConditionalDistributions.m'.
Simply run the script and it will output all the relevant information.

Q2 - Training Conditional Gaussian Classifiers
The training of the Conditional Gaussian classifier is done in the function 'trainConditionalGaussian.m'.
The call to the training function and it's plotting is done in the script 'Q2_TrainingConditionalGaussianClassifiers.m'.
To run files, simply run the script and it will plot the handwritten digits means and the variance.

Q3 - Training Naive Bayes Classifiers
The training of the Naive Bayes classifier is done in the function 'trainNaiveBayes.m'.
The call to the training function and it's plotting is done in the script 'Q3_TrainingNaiveBayesClassifiers.m'.
To run files, simply run the script and it will plot the handwritten digits.

Q4 - Test Performance
The testing of the Conditional Gaussian and Naive Bayes Classifiers are all contained within the script 'Q4_TestPerformance.m'.
The script calls the correct training function for each classifier, and then calculates the error occurrences for each label and error rate.
To run, simply run the script and it will output the error rates table.
